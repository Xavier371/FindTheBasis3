        <h2>Catch the Point</h2>
        <p>
            The game begins with you as the blue point, trying to catch the red point. 
            Every move, a random edge is removed from the game, try to corner the red point 
            before an edge is removed and the points are separated. Switch the defense mode 
            to try to evade the red point for as long as possible, and switch to two players 
            to play with a friend.

        <h2>Find the Basis</h2>
        <p>
            The vectors i and j form the unit square that spans all 2 dimensional space. 
            Drag and drop i' and j' to transform the unit square so that the blue point falls 
            on red. Once you believe your transformation will correctly map the initial blue 
            vector onto the red, press go and try to get it as fast as possible. Click solve 
            to see how you get to a (non unique) solution. Click help to learn more about how 
            the game works.

        <h2>Graph the Match</h2>
        <p>
            The red points are you and your friends, the blue points are another friend group. 
            Each person can talk to exactly one person at a time, and the edge weights represent 
            the compatibility score between those two people. Try and click the set of edges 
            that maximize the total compatibility score for the matching.
