        <h2>Catch the Point</h2>
        <p>
            An exciting strategic pursuit game where players navigate through a dynamic grid system. 
            Play in offense mode to catch the red point, or switch to defense mode to evade capture. 
            The challenge intensifies as paths disappear after each move, requiring quick thinking 
            and careful planning. Features both single-player AI and two-player modes, making it 
            perfect for testing your tactical skills alone or competing with friends.

        <h2>Find the Basis</h2>
        <p>
            A unique linear algebra visualization game that challenges your understanding of 
            vector transformations. Manipulate basis vectors (i' and j') to transform the 
            coordinate space and map a blue point onto a red target. Through rotations, 
            reflections, and scaling, discover how 2x2 matrices transform space. Perfect for 
            students learning linear transformations or anyone interested in interactive 
            mathematical visualization.

        <h2>Graph the Match</h2>
        <p>
            An engaging optimization puzzle based on the maximum weighted matching problem. 
            Connect nodes between two sets to create the highest-scoring matching, where no 
            vertex can be used twice. Inspired by real-world applications like job matching 
            and ride-sharing algorithms, this game combines graph theory with practical 
            problem-solving. Adjust the size of each set to increase the challenge and test 
            your optimization skills.
